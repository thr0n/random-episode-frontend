# random-episode-frontend

I really love audio dramas, espacially "Die drei ???"
(_Three Investigators_)!

But sometimes it's really hard to find the right episode that
fits my mood.
Also, my wife is not a good randomizer. When I ask her for an
episode ID, she answers "73!" most of the time ðŸ˜‰
. But episode 73 of "Die drei ???" is "Poltergeist" which is not
a good episode if you want to listen to something while you try
to fall asleep ðŸ‘» ðŸ˜±

So, there was only one way out: I had to develop my own random
episode generator!

I've also made a small screen recording if you are curious how
random-episode works and looks like:
